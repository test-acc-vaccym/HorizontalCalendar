A horizontal calendar scrollable and customizable. Programmed 100% in Kotlin. Calendar available in Spanish and English.

## Installation
Very easy! The library is hosted on jcenter. You just have to add this to your project in **build.gradle** :

```gradle
repositories {
      jcenter()
}
    
dependencies {
      compile 'com.rudo:horizontalcalendar:0.3.1'
}
```

## Usage

1. First add the view in the layout you want: 

```xml
<com.rudo.calendarhorizontal.HorizontalCalendarView
    android:id="@+id/horizontalcalendarview"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>

```

2. Initialize the calendar with the basic fields in your Activity or Fragment:

  Kotlin:
```kotlin
HorizontalCalendar.Build(YOUR_ACTIVITY,
                   R.id.horizontalcalendarview, //Id of the calendar view
                   BasicStyle( //Basic Style of the calendar
                      R.color.YOUR_COLOR,  //Color of the days before the current date
                      R.color.YOUR_COLOR, //Color of the days after the current date
                      R.color.YOUR_COLOR)) //Color of the current day
                   .build() 
```
  Java: 
```java
new HorizontalCalendar.Build(YOUR_ACTIVITY,
                   R.id.horizontalcalendarview, //Id of the calendar view
                   new BasicStyle( //Basic Style of the calendar
                      R.color.YOUR_COLOR,  //Color of the days before the current date
                      R.color.YOUR_COLOR, //Color of the days after the current date
                      R.color.YOUR_COLOR)) //Color of the current day
                   .build() 
```
This option will take the default values

## Customization
You can customize the default values of the calendar setting this fields in Build.

- Days in screen. You can choose the number of days shown on the screen at the same time:

```java
   ...
   .daysInScreen(NUMBER_OF_DAYS)
   ...
```

- Maximum days range. Maximum number of days / months that can be selected before and after the current date.

```java
   ...
   .rangeMax(7,HorizontalCalendar.TIMEMEASURE.DAY) //You can choose months directly with TIMEMEASURE.MONTH
   ...
```

- Extra period. You can select an extra period in the calendar. This period is going to show a different color.

```java
   ...
   .periodSelected(DATE_START,
                   DATE_END,
                   R.color.YOUR_COLOR) //different color of that period of days
   ...
```

- Selected days. You can select calendar days to highlight them with a lower icon. The days do not need to be correlated.

```java
  ...
  .selectedDays(LIST_DATES, //ArrayList of Dates to select
                R.color.YOUR_COLOR) //Color of the lower icon
  ...
```

 - Listener. Collect all the clicks of the calendar and the data of the day clicked
 
  Java: 
 ```java 
 ...
 .onClickDay(new OnClickDateCalendar() {
            @Override
            public void onClickDate(@NotNull Date date, boolean isInExtraRange, boolean isSelected) {
              //Class date of the day clicked.
              //If has extra period
              //If is selected
            }
        })
 ...
 ```
 
  Kotlin (Implement OnClickDateCalendar interface in the Activity): 
 ```kotlin
 ...
 .onClickDay(this)
 ...
 ...
 override fun onClickDate(date: Date, isInExtraRange: Boolean, isSelected: Boolean) {
       // date: Class date of the day clicked.
       //isInExtraRange: If has extra period
       //isSelected: If is selected
    }
 ...

 ```
